            <h2>Simon Sulek's video, An introvert who inspire dozens of million of people</h2>
            <p>The speaker in this video presents the "golden circle" concept, which explains why some organizations and leaders inspire while others do not. This concept has three layers: "What" (what they do), "How" (how they do it), and "Why" (their purpose or belief). The speaker argues that inspired leaders communicate from the inside-out, starting with "why," because "people don't buy what you do, people buy why you do it." This approach is supported by the structure of the human brain, where the limbic system, responsible for feelings and decision-making, corresponds to the "why" and "how." Examples like Apple, the Wright brothers, and Martin Luther King Jr. are used to illustrate the power of this "why"-first communication. The video also touches on the "law of diffusion of innovation," emphasizing the importance of attracting early adopters who believe in your "why" for mass-market success.</p>

            <h2>The road not taken, when simple expirience can be so beautiful</h2>
            <p>This video narrates Robert Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken." The poem describes a traveler's decision when faced with two diverging paths, and the reflection on how this choice will significantly impact their future. The video concludes by highlighting that choosing the "one less traveled by" made all the difference.</p>
